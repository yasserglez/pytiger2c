# PyTiger2C

PyTiger2C is a compiler for the Tiger programming language written in [Python]. 

Tiger is an [Algol]-like programming language outlined in the book [Modern Compiler Implementation in Java/ML/C][modern] by [Andrew W. Appel][appel]. PyTiger2C translates a Tiger program given as input into a [C] program that can be then compiled to create an executable for an specific platform.

The project was created by [Yasser González Fernández][ygf] and [Ariel Hernández Amador][gnuaha7] in fulfillment of the final assignment of an undergraduate course on language theory and compiler construction for Computer Science students taught at the [University of Havana][uh], Cuba. Therefore, the documentation of the project and the git comments were written in Spanish. Everything in the Python code but the docstrings is in English, though.
