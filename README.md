PyTiger2C
---------

A compiler for the Tiger programming language written in Python.

Tiger is an Algol-like programming language outlined in the book
[Modern Compiler Implementation in Java/ML/C][modern] by
[Andrew W. Appel][appel]. PyTiger2C translates a Tiger program
into a C program that can be then compiled to create an executable
for an specific platform.

The project was created by [Yasser González Fernández][ygf] and
[Ariel Hernández Amador][gnuaha7] as the final assignment of an
undergraduate course on language theory and compiler construction for
Computer Science students taught at the University of Havana, Cuba.
The project documentation is written in Spanish.
